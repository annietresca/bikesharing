# Bikesharing

## Project Overview

This project intends to provide visual insight into Citibike data in order to help guide investors in future bikesharing endeavors. The data set being discussed is that of Citibike in NYC. 



## Resources

Data: new.csv, NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb

Software: Tableau, Python, Visual Studio Code


## Results

Here are some findings from the analysis:

- There were 2,344,224 total Citibike users in NYC in the month of August, 1,900,359 of which were subscribers.
- August was a busy month for biking in a large city. Peak biking hours were between 5:00p-7:00p.
- In addition to happy hour being a popular time for biking, morning commutes and weekend bike rides were also very busy. 
- Males utilized the service more than females.
- Most bike riders utilized the service for 5-18 minutes. 
- Males are more likely to utilize the service for a longer time on a given ride.
- Male subscribers bring in the bulk of business in the summers, especially on Thursdays!



## Summary
As a result of completing this analysis, it can be concluded that bike sharing is a popular mode of transportation in the summer months. While some investors might be deterred by biking in the heat, it is clear in the data set that that is not a concern to users! Male subscribers are the most reliable form of consumers and are most likely to utilize the services during happy hour/ the commute home from work, especially on Thursdays and the weekends. While the visuals created do provide a great insight into what can be anticipated with opening a bike sharing service, I do have some suggestions for future visualizations to aid in decision making. One visual I would suggest is mapping how close the bike stations are to train stations. Are subscribers using the bike service to get around the city for leisure? Are they using it to eliminate one form of transportation as they make their way towards another? If train stations do show to have higher instances of usage, are there certain train stations that are higher in traffic? Additionally, another visual I would suggest is mapping usage in a colder month. Being that the summer is a time that folks want to get outside, it would prove important to see how frequently users utilize the services in the winter. By looking at a month such as January, we could see how many total users could be anticipated around that time of year as well as how long average bike ride are. This data could potentially impact the total number of bike stations set up in a given city.
